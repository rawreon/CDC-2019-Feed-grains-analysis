This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
grains =  read.csv('feedgrains.csv')
new_grains = read.csv("Crop_State.csv")
grainsUS = grains %>% filter(grains$SC_GeographyIndented_Desc == "United States")
unique(grainsUS$SC_Attribute_Desc)
unique(grainsUS$SC_GroupCommod_Desc)
prices = grainsUS %>% filter(grainsUS$SC_Attribute_Desc == "Prices received by farmers")
prices %>% filter(prices$SC_GroupCommod_Desc == "Oats")
directory <- ("./Downloads/")

```

```{r}
grains_weather = right_join(new_grains, weather, by = c("State" = "NAME" ))
joined = inner_join(grains_weather, prices, by = c("ï..Commodity" = "SC_GroupCommod_Desc", "YEAR" = "Year_ID", "MONTH" = "Timeperiod_ID" ))

```

```{r}
unique(prices$SC_Unit_Desc)
dim(prices[which(prices$SC_Unit_Desc=="Dollars per bushel"),])
dim(prices[which(prices$SC_Unit_Desc=="Dollars per cwt"),])
dim(prices[which(prices$SC_Unit_Desc=="Dollars per ton"),])
write.csv(joined)

subset_joined = joined %>% filter(joined$SC_Unit_Desc == "Dollars per bushel")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
